# SQ2CPA LoRa APRS Balloon

## Check my parts list [here](https://github.com/SQ2CPA/parts)

This firmware is suitable for LoRa based balloon trackers. For now its good for **HT-CT62** board that includes **ESP32C3+SX1262**. It contains many good features like historical location, current flight day detection and even digipeater so you can repeat your messages via balloon!

More information should available soon.

Based on **Ricardo CA2RXU** LoRa software that is available [here](https://github.com/richonguzman/LoRa_APRS_iGate).
